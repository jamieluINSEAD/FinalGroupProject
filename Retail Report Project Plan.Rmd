========================================================

**INSEAD MBA Big Data and Analytics Course*


Project Plan 
---------------------------------------------------------
Imagine you have access to user behavior of a large consumer electronics retailer website. What products are commonly bought together? What can you do with that information? You will have access to the amount of visitors that watched every product, what kind of recommendations would you make if some were bought more often than others?
